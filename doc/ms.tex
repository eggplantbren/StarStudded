\section{Decision Theory}
Now we have a posterior distribution $p(C|\data)$ for the catalog
\begin{eqnarray}
C = \left\{N,\{x_i, y_i, \{f_{ij}\}\}_{i=1}^N \right\}
\end{eqnarray}
we might want to choose a point estimate catalog $\hat{C}$ which
maximises the expected value of a utility function $U(\hat{C}, C)$.\\

The expected utility is
\begin{eqnarray}
\mathds{E}\left[U(\hat{C}, C)\right]
&=&
\int U(\hat{C}, C) p(C | \data) \, dC,
\end{eqnarray}
which can be approximated by averaging over a set $\{C_i\}_{i=1}^n$
of catalogs produced from a Monte Carlo sampling of the posterior distribution
$p(C|\data)$:
\begin{eqnarray}
\mathds{E}\left[U(\hat{C}, C)\right]
&\approx&
\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n U(\hat{C}, C_i).
\end{eqnarray}
Once we have sampled the posterior, we can do an optimisation to choose the
catalog estimate $\hat{C}$ which maximises the approximate expected utility.

\section{A suggested utility function}
This is just an idea, and I am open to alternative suggestions.

A catalog is a measure. It also implies other measures (e.g. a blurred catalog
is like an image).

I propose
\begin{eqnarray}
U(\hat{C}, C) &=& \textnormal{Div}\left(m(x, y; \hat{C}); m(x, y; C)\right)
\end{eqnarray}
where $\textnormal{Div}$ is the divergence function for measures (from Knuth
and Skilling), and the two $m$s are measures over the sky produced from the
point estimate catalog and the true catalog respectively.
