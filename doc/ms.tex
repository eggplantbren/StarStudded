% Abstract of the paper
\begin{abstract}
Detecting and characterizing the sources in an image is a fundamental task
in astronomy. This can be regarded as an inference problem, where the goal
is to determine what statements about the objects are plausible, given the
data and some assumed prior information. In this paper we present a new
implementation of this idea for the case of crowded stellar fields.
We also formally address the question of how to choose a single optimal
catalog for publication, using concepts from decision theory.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% BODY OF PAPER %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Introduction}
How many sources are in an image? Where are they located, how bright are they,
and what are their other properties (e.g. shape-related properties)? These
are fundamental questions in astronomy.


\citet{brewer2013probabilistic} addressed this question from the point of view
of Bayesian inference, showing how the posterior distribution over the space of possible catalogs can be computed and can enable greater scientific output from
a dataset, provided the modelling assumptions are sufficiently accurate. In
particular, the frequency distribution of fluxes at the faint end was much
more accurately recovered using inference than using standard object detection
package SExtractor.

In this paper, we describe a new implementation of the
\citet{brewer2013probabilistic}
method, which samples the posterior distribution for possible catalogs
given the data. 

The implementation is in C++ and makes use of the DNest4 package
\citep{dnest4}, which implements the Diffusive Nested Sampling algorithm
\citep{dns}. We also discuss the question of how to choose one optimal catalog
rather than presenting a sample of plausible catalogs. We do this formally
using decision theory.


\section{Inference and decision theory}
In Bayesian inference, the posterior distribution for the parameters
$\params$ given data $\data$ and prior information $\info$ is proportional
to the prior $p(\params | \info)$
times the likelihood $p(\data | \params, \info)$.
\begin{align}
p(\params | \data, \info) &=
    \frac{p(\params | \info)p(\data | \params, \info)}{p(\data | \info)}.
\end{align}
Bayesian inference (i.e., probability theory) is used to model uncertainty
because any assignment of real values to
ordered pairs of propositions $(A, B)$, that satisfies basic
symmetries, is equivalent to a conditional probability $P(A | B)$.
\citep{knuth2012foundations}. The posterior distribution quantifies the degree
to which the data $\data$ implies certain conclusions about the value of
$\theta$, within the context of $\info$.

Now we have a posterior distribution $p(C|\data, \info)$ for the catalog
\begin{eqnarray}
C = \left\{N,\{x_i, y_i, \{f_{ij}\}\}_{i=1}^N \right\}
\end{eqnarray}
we might want to choose a point estimate catalog $\hat{C}$ which
maximises the expected value of a utility function $U(\hat{C}, C)$.\\

The expected utility is
\begin{eqnarray}
\mathds{E}\left[U(\hat{C}, C)\right]
&=&
\int U(\hat{C}, C) p(C | \data) \, dC,
\end{eqnarray}
which can be approximated by averaging over a set $\{C_i\}_{i=1}^n$
of catalogs produced from a Monte Carlo sampling of the posterior distribution
$p(C|\data)$:
\begin{eqnarray}
\mathds{E}\left[U(\hat{C}, C)\right]
&\approx&
\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n U(\hat{C}, C_i).
\end{eqnarray}
Once we have sampled the posterior, we can do an optimisation to choose the
catalog estimate $\hat{C}$ which maximises the approximate expected utility.

Idea for quick implementation: use the DNest4 samples ({\tt sample.txt})
as the set of possible decisions.

\section{A utility related to images}
Again, let $\hat{C}$ be the 

I propose
\begin{eqnarray}
U(\hat{C}, C) &=& \textnormal{Div}\left(m(x, y; \hat{C}); m(x, y; C)\right)
\end{eqnarray}
where $\textnormal{Div}$ is the unique divergence of
two measures \citep{knuth2012foundations}.

The two $m(x, y)$ functions are measures over the sky produced from the
point estimate catalog and the true catalog respectively. They cannot be
measures where the stars create point masses, because the divergence would
be infinite unless the stars coincided.

The procedure here resembles how we fit the catalog to the images in the
first place. But we're not trying to optimize the fit to the image. Instead,
we're trying to find the posterior sample that is as `close' as possible to
all of the other posterior samples, as defined by the divergence. That catalog
that is most representative of all catalogs that are probable under the
posterior distribution is the best single catalog we could asset.
