To generate fake data in Code/Data/

change level in OPTION to 1
run `make` if we change anything in C++ code
./main 
--> sample.txt

in python:
for 1 band: 
e.g. dependeing on the dimension specified in the _metadata.txt; here e.g. 100 X 100
- take first 10,000 elements and reshape into (100,100), save as _data.txt
  x = loadtxt('sample.txt')
  -- should add random noise by:
  noise = np.random.rand(ndim, ndim)
  im = x[0,100**2].reshape((100,100))+noise
  imshow(im, interpolation='nearest')
  imshow(log(im)+1, interpolation='nearest')
- make an zero array of the same shape, save as _sigma.txt

for multiple bands:
reshape into (num_band,100,100)
x = loadtxt('sample.txt').reshape((2,100,100))
then, you can display
1st band:
im_1 = x[0, 0*200**2:(1)*200**2].reshape((200,200))
imshow(im_1)

to convert from sample.txt into _Data.txt
shape in (num_band, 200**2)
saveim[band_1,ndim**2] = im_1
saveim[band_2, ndim**2] = im_2
etc.
